1. The use case - component hierarchy
2. Prop drilling approach
3. The Context and Consumer
    - talk about default value 
    - Compare with import approach
5. Add provider 
    - Provider lets use dynamically configure
6. Redux vs Context
    - Redux requires more code to connect
    - This is native approach
    - not every project uses Redux
7. Using multiple contexts - functional vs classes
8. Using higher order components
